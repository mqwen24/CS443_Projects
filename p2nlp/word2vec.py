class Skipgram:
    '''A Skip-gram neural network (word2vec approach) that takes target words as data samples and learns to predict the
    surrounding context words ("classes"). The network learns emergent numerical word embedding vectors for the target
    words based on word context.

    The network has an MLP archeciture:
    Input -> Dense (linear act) -> Dense (softmax act)

    def __init__(self, num_feats, num_hidden, num_classes, wt_stdev=0.1):
        '''Constructor to intialize the network weights and bias. Skip-gram is a 2 layer MLP network (not counting the
        input layer).

        Parameters:
        -----------
        num_feats: int. Num input features (M)
        num_hidden: int. Num of units in the hidden layer (H)
        num_classes: int. Num data classes (C)
        wt_stdev: float. Standard deviation of the Gaussian-distributed weights and bias

        TODO:
        - Create Gaussian-distributed wts and bias tensors for each layer of the network. Remember to wrap your weights
        and bias as tf.Variables for gradient tracking!

    def multi_hot(self, y_ind_list, num_classes):

        Parameters:
        -----------
        y_ind_list: ndarray of ndarrays. len(outer ndarray)=B, len(each inner ndarray)= = Si.
            int-coded class assignments for each sample i in the training mini-batch
            (i.e.) indices of the context words associated with each target word i in the mini-batch.
            NOTE: THe number of context words (Si) is NOT THE SAME for each sample (target word) i!
        num_classes int. Number of unique output classes total (i.e. vocab size)

        Returns:
        -----------
        y_multi_h: tf.constant. tf.float32. shape=(B, C) Multi-hot coded class assignments.

        NOTE:
        - Because of the uneven/jagged number of context words for the samples in the mini-batch, it is difficult to use
        only vectorization to implement this. Using one loop here is totally fine!
        - Because you are building a constant tensor, it might be easier to build the mini-batch of multi-hot vectors in
        numpy and then convert to a TensorFlow tensor at the end.

        Parameters:

        x: tf.constant. shape=(B, M). Data samples

        Returns:
        -----------
        net_in: tf.constant. shape=(B, C). net_in in the output layer to every sample in the mini-batch.

        NOTE:
        - You are returning NET_IN rather than the usual NET_ACT here because the Skip-gram loss involves the output
        layer net_in instead of the output layer net_act.

    def loss(self, z_net_in, y_multi_h):
        '''Computes the Skip-gram loss on the current mini-batch using the multi-hot coded class labels `y_multi_h`.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        z_net_in: tf.constant. shape=(B, C). Net input to every sample in the mini-batch in the output layer.
        y_multi_h: tf.constant. tf.float32. shape=(B, C). Multi-hot coded class assignments (i.e. 1s at context word
            indices, 0s elsewhere for each sample).
            For example:
            y_multi_h = [[0 1 0 0]
                         [0 1 0 1]]
            means that sample 0 in the mini-batch has one context word that has index 1 in the vocab. Sample 1 in the
            mini-batch has two context words that have indices 1 and 3 in the vocab.

        Returns:
        -----------
        loss: float. Skip-gram loss averaged over the mini-batch.

        Hints:
        - It may be a good idea to break down the loss equation and implement each component on separate lines of code.
        - Check out https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_logsumexp
        - To implement the right-most term in the loss equation, it may be helpful to notice that y_multi_h has the same
        shape as z_net_in and y_multi_h has 1s at all the context word positions (yc in the equation) and 0s elsewhere.
        Thus, you can use y_multi_h as a "gate" or a "filter" to extract z_net_in values that are at the appropriate
        context words and at the same time nulling out the remaining z_net_in values that are not desired.

    def extract_at_indices(self, x, indices):

        Parameters:

        x: tf.constant. shape=(N, ...). Data samples or labels
        indices: tf.constant. tf.int32, shape=(B,), Indices of samples to return from `x` to form a mini-batch.
            Indices may be in any order, there may be duplicate indices, and B may be less than N (i.e. a mini-batch).
            For example indices could be [0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1], or [2, 1].
            In the case of [2, 1] this method would samples with index 2 and index 1 (in that order).

        Returns:
        -----------
        tf.constant. shape=(B, ...). Value extracted from `x` whose sample indices are `indices`.

        (your choice).
        - For each mini-batch, one-hot code target words and multi-hot code context words.
        - Compute forward pass and loss for each mini-batch. Have your Adam optimizer apply the gradients to update each
        wts and bias.
        - Record the average training loss values across all mini-batches.
