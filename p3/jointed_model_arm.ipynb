    "# Project 3: Outstar Learning and Motor Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will train a neural network to control a model 3-jointed arm so that it successfully reaches for one or more specified targets. The **Outstar learning rule** governs how weights are learned between between activation of neurons that sense the state of the arm and the required muscle movements to move toward the target. You will explore how you can use **self-supervised learning** to solve a complex task without pre-specified labels: the network learns how to move the arm by observing the consequences of the random movements that the arm makes. In other words, the model arm *learns by generating its own data about the world*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus this week will be on building and visualizing the model arm. Next week, the focus will be on implementing and exploring how the Outstar learning rule works. With both the arm and the Outstar neural network implement, on the third week you will train the model arm to reach for targets. \n",

    "## Task 1: Build and visualize model arm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The model arm is composed of the following components, each of which is its own class:\n",
    "- `Joint` (`joint.py`): Each object represents ONE of the three arm joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist).\n",
    "- `EndEffector` (`joint.py`): This is the hand that is attached to the wrist joint, which must intercept with a target (i.e. come in contact with the target).\n",
    "- `Muscles` (`muscles.py`) (the \"sink\" layer): Each object represents the SIX arm muscles, each of which moves an arm joint through space. These six muscles are grouped in **agonist-antagonist pairs** and each pair controls the movement of one arm joint. For example, activation of the elbow agonist muscle moves the lower arm (forearm, wrist, and hand) CLOSER to the center (in front of the virtual person), while activation of the the elbow antagonist muscle moves the lower arm outward, AWAY from the center. *We represent all six muscles in a single object for efficiency â€” it allows for batch matrix multiplication by the Outstar network.*\n",
    "- `MotorNeurons` (`motor_neurons.py`) (the \"source\" layer): The motorneurons sense the current state of the arm. Each object represents a large collection of neurons that activate the muscles (that in turn move the arm). Each neuron activates only when the 3 arm joints are approximately in the neuron's \"preferred\" configuration. For example, one neuron might \"prefer\" when the angle of shoulder joint is roughly 0Â° and the angle of the elbow joint is roughly 90Â° and the angle of the angle of the wrist joint is roughly 45Â°. Each neuron prefers a different combination of these angles.\n",
    "- `Outstar` (`outstar.py`): Outstar neural network in which the source neurons are the `MotorNeurons` and the sink neurons are the `Muscles`. The network learns the **muscle (sink)** activations necessary to reach for the target given the activation pattern of the **motor neurons (source)**, which code the current state of the arm."
