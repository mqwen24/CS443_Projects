        Parameters:
        ----------
        map_sz: tuple of 2 ints. (n_rows, n_cols). Number of units in each dimension of the SOM.
            e.g. map_sz=(9, 10) -> the SOM will have 9x10 units arranged in a grid
            of 9 rows and 10 columns.
        num_feats: int. Number of features in a SINGLE data sample feature vector.

        bmu_rc: tuple. (row, col) in the SOM grid of current best-matching unit (BMU).
        sigma: float. Standard deviation of the Gaussian at the current training iteration.

        ----------
        ndarray. shape=(n_rows, n_cols). 2D Gaussian, weighted by the the current learning rate.

        TODO:
        - Evaluate a Gaussian on a 2D grid with shape=(n_rows, n_cols) centered on `bmu_rc`.


        HINT:
        This will likely involve generating 2D grids of (row, col) index values (i.e. positions in
        the 2D grid) in the range [0, ..., n_rows-1, 0, ..., n_cols-1].
            shape of som_grid_cols: (n_rows, n_cols)
            shape of som_grid_rows: (n_rows, n_cols)
        You already solved this problem in Project 0 of CS343 :)
        If you adopt this approach, move the initialization of these row and column matrices to the
        constructor, since generating them everytime you call `gaussian` will slow down your code.

        bmu_rc: tuple. BMU (x,y) position in the SOM grid.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        x: ndarray. shape=(N, num_feats) N training data samples.
        n_epochs: int. Number of training epochs to do
        lr: float. INITIAL learning rate during learning. This will decay with time
            (iteration number). The effective learning rate will only equal this if t=0.
        lr_decay: float. Multiplicative decay rate for learning rate.
        sigma: float. INITIAL standard deviation of Gaussian neighborhood in which units
            cooperate during learning. This will decay with time (iteration number).
            The effective learning rate will only equal this if t=0.
        sigma_decay: float. Multiplicative decay rate for Gaussian neighborhood sigma.
        print_every: int. Print the epoch, lr, sigma, and BMU error every `print_every` epochs.
            NOTE: When first implementing this, ignore "BMU error". You will be computing this soon,
            at which point you can go back and add it.
        verbose: boolean. Whether to print out debug information at various stages of the algorithm.
            NOTE: if verbose=False, nothing should print out during training. Messages indicating start and
        end of training are fine.

        TODO:
        Although this is an unsupervised learning algorithm, the training process is similar to usual:
        - Train SGD-style — one sample at a time. For each epoch you should either sample with replacement or without
        replacement (shuffle) between epochs (your choice).
            - If you shuffle the entire dataset each epoch, be careful not to accidentally modify the original data
            passed in.
        - Within each epoch: compute the BMU of each data sample, update its weights and those of its neighbors, and
        decay the learning rate and Gaussian neighborhood sigma.
