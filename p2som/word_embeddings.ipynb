    "You will train a Skip-gram (word2vec) neural network commonly used in the field of natural language processing (NLP) on text from IMDb user movie reviews. The goal of the network is to predict **context words** (the words surrounding each word in a sentence). After implementing and training the network, you will extract the weights to obtain $H$ dimensional **word embedding** vectors for English words that appeared in the movie reviews. You will continue to leverage TensorFlow to implement and train the Skip-gram neural network on the IMDd dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the project (`word_cloud.ipynb`), you will implement a self-organizing map (SOM), a competitive bio-inspired neural network that performs dimensionality reduction on its inputs. This network will learn the nonlinear structure of the IMDb word embeddings (in $H$ dimensions) (*unsupervised learning*) and allow you to visualize the words in a 2D space. Remarkably, words with similar meanings should appear nearby each other, even though the network knows nothing about the definitions of the words!"

Because the input layer of the network has $M$ units, you will one-hot code each target word: it is coded as a vector of zeros with length `vocab_sz` with a 1 at the position represented by the word's int code. For example, if `tourists` has an int code of 2, then its one-hot vector looks like `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,....]`.\n",

For example, if $W=2$, the sentence is `I want to see the new Star Wars movie, how about you?`, and the target word is `the`, then the context words are `[to, see, new, Star]`. Context words play the role of `y` (i.e. there are multiple \"classes\" per data sample). Eventually, you will represent each target word's set of context words as a \"*multi-hot vector*\": a vector of length `vocab_sz` with zeros everywhere except there are 1s at all the context word indices. As with target words, you will store the set as int codes for now (for efficiency) and convert to multi-hot vectors when forming mini-batches during training.\n",

    "<br> The problem is that data with more than 2 dimensions is hard for humans to interpret. \n",

    "**Answer 2:** \n",
    "The number of input and output neurons in the Skip-gram network should both be equal to the vocab size (the number of unique words in the corpus).\n",
